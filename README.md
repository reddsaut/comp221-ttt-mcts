# MCTS Implemention with Tic-Tac-Toe

An example implementation and its use is demonstrated using solving Tic-tac-toe (with simulated players) using a monte-carlo tree search approach.

# To Use:

Run *MCTS.java* to see a simulated step-by-step game of TTT. As MCST find the most optimal next choice for both players, the game will always end in a draw. 

To test, ensure that each simulation of a game always end a draw.
